# PDBe mmCIF Validator

A Visual Studio Code extension to validate mmCIF/CIF files against the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary (or any CIF dictionary) with real-time error checking.

## Features

- ✅ **Real-time validation** - Automatically validates mmCIF files as you edit
- ✅ **Error highlighting** - Errors and warnings are highlighted directly in the editor with precise character positioning
- ✅ **Syntax highlighting** - Full syntax highlighting for CIF files (tags, values, data blocks, loops, etc.)
- ✅ **Hover information** - Hover over any value to see its corresponding key (`_tag`) and data block
- ✅ **Dictionary support** - Works with the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary or any CIF dictionary format
- ✅ **Flexible dictionary sources** - Uses local dictionary files or downloads from URL
- ✅ **Auto-detection** - Automatically finds dictionary files in your workspace
- ✅ **Comprehensive checks** - Validates mandatory items, enumerations, and schema compliance
- ✅ **Works out-of-the-box** - No configuration required!

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "PDBe mmCIF Validator"
4. Click Install

## Quick Start

The extension works out-of-the-box! By default, it will automatically:
- Download and cache the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary from the official wwPDB website (http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic)
- Cache the dictionary locally for one month to balance freshness with download efficiency
- Dictionary updates are usually released in conjunction with OneDep software releases (average update frequency ~43 days)
- Validate any `.cif` files you open
- Show errors and warnings in the Problems panel with precise character positioning

**No configuration required!** However, you can also use any other CIF dictionary by configuring the `dictionaryPath` or `dictionaryUrl` settings (see Configuration section below).

## Usage

1. Open a `.cif` file in VSCode
2. The extension will automatically:
   - Apply syntax highlighting to make the file easier to read
   - Validate the file (on open, save, and changes with 1 second debounce)
3. **Hover over any value** to see:
   - The corresponding key (`_tag`)
   - The data block name (`DATA_*`)
   - Loop information (if in a loop)
4. Errors and warnings will be highlighted in the editor
5. Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and run "mmCIF: Validate" to manually trigger validation

## Configuration

The extension works with sensible defaults, but you can customize it in VSCode settings (File → Preferences → Settings):

### Settings

- **`mmcifValidator.dictionaryUrl`** (default: `http://mmcif.pdb.org/dictionaries/ascii/mmcif_pdbx.dic`)
  - URL to download the dictionary from. Defaults to the official PDBx/mmCIF dictionary, but you can use any CIF dictionary URL.
  - Works out-of-the-box with the default!
  
- **`mmcifValidator.dictionaryPath`** (optional)
  - Path to a local dictionary file. Can be absolute or relative to workspace root.
  - Use this to validate against any CIF dictionary file (not just PDBx/mmCIF).
  - If not set, the extension will look for common dictionary filenames in the workspace.
  
- **`mmcifValidator.pythonPath`** (default: `python`)
  - Path to Python executable. Use this if Python is not in your PATH.
  
- **`mmcifValidator.enabled`** (default: `true`)
  - Enable/disable validation

### Example Settings

**Use default (recommended):**
```json
{
  "mmcifValidator.enabled": true
}
```

**Use local dictionary file:**
```json
{
  "mmcifValidator.dictionaryPath": "mmcif_pdbx_v5_next.dic"
}
```

**Use a different CIF dictionary (e.g., for small molecule CIF files):**
```json
{
  "mmcifValidator.dictionaryPath": "path/to/your/cif_dictionary.dic"
}
```

**Use a dictionary from a different URL:**
```json
{
  "mmcifValidator.dictionaryUrl": "https://example.com/path/to/dictionary.dic"
}
```

**Custom Python path:**
```json
{
  "mmcifValidator.pythonPath": "C:\\Python39\\python.exe"
}
```

## Validation Checks

The validator performs the following checks:

1. **Item Definition**: Verifies that items used in the mmCIF file are defined in the dictionary
2. **Mandatory Items**: Checks that all mandatory items are present (only for categories that exist in the file)
3. **Enumeration Values**: Validates that item values match allowed enumerations (reported as errors)
   - Handles enumerations with only `_item_enumeration.value` (no detail field)
   - Handles enumerations with both `value` and `detail` fields
4. **Data Type Validation**: Validates that values match their expected data types
   - **Regex patterns from dictionary** - Automatically validates any type code that has a regex pattern defined in `_item_type_list.construct` (e.g., `email`, `phone`, `orcid_id`, `pdb_id`, `fax`, etc.)
   - **Hardcoded validations** for common types:
     - Date formats: `yyyy-mm-dd`, `yyyy-mm-dd:hh:mm`, `yyyy-mm-dd:hh:mm-flex`
     - Numeric types: `int`, `positive_int`, `float`, `float-range`
     - Boolean type: `boolean`
5. **Range Validation**: Checks numeric values against minimum/maximum constraints
   - **Strictly Allowed Boundary Conditions** (`_item_range`): Violations are reported as **errors**
   - **Advisory Boundary Conditions** (`_pdbx_item_range`): Violations are reported as **warnings** with "Out of advisory range:" prefix
6. **Parent/Child Category Validation**: Validates category relationships
   - Verifies that when a child category is present, its parent category is also present
   - Example: If `entity_src_nat` (child) is present, `entity` (parent) must also be present
7. **Foreign Key Integrity**: Validates that foreign key values in child items exist in their parent items
   - Example: `_entity_src_nat.entity_id` values must exist in `_entity.id`
8. **Composite Key Validation**: Validates that combinations of multiple child items together match corresponding combinations in parent categories
   - Example: In `pdbx_entity_poly_domain`, the combination of `begin_mon_id` + `begin_seq_num` must match a row in `entity_poly_seq` where `mon_id` + `num` appear together as a pair
   - Validates relationships where multiple items form a composite foreign key (identified by `link_group_id` in the dictionary)
   - **Special handling for label/auth field combinations**: Categories like `struct_conn`, `pdbx_struct_conn_angle`, `geom_*`, `atom_site_anisotrop`, and others have composite keys that include both label and auth fields. The validator intelligently handles these by:
     - First attempting validation using label fields (if complete)
     - Falling back to auth fields when label fields are incomplete (e.g., when `label_seq_id` is missing)
     - Using `label_atom_id` when `auth_atom_id` is not present in the file
     - This ensures atoms referenced in these categories are properly validated against `atom_site` even when some fields are missing
9. **Operation Expression Validation**: Validates `oper_expression` values that reference operation IDs
   - Parses complex operation expressions: `(1)`, `(1,2,5)`, `(1-4)`, `(1,2)(3,4)`, `(X0)(1-5,11-15)`
   - Validates that all referenced operation IDs exist in `_pdbx_struct_oper_list.id`
   - Example: If `oper_expression` is `(1-60)`, validates that operation IDs 1 through 60 all exist
10. **Category-aware validation**: Only checks mandatory items for categories that are actually present in the mmCIF file
11. **First data block only**: By default, only validates the first data block in files containing multiple data blocks (each starting with `data_`)

## Error vs Warning Severity

The validator reports issues with different severity levels:

### Errors (Red Underline)
These are violations of mandatory constraints that must be fixed:

- **Missing Mandatory Items**: Required items that are missing from categories present in the file
- **Enumeration Violations**: Values that don't match the controlled vocabulary/enumeration list
- **Data Type Mismatches**: Values that don't match their expected data type
- **Strictly Allowed Range Violations** (`_item_range`): Values outside the strictly allowed boundary conditions
- **Parent Category Missing**: Child categories present but their required parent categories are missing
- **Foreign Key Integrity Violations**: Foreign key values that don't exist in their parent items
- **Composite Key Violations**: Combinations of multiple child items that don't match corresponding combinations in parent categories (including label/auth field combinations)
- **Invalid Operation Expression References**: Operation expressions referencing operation IDs that don't exist

### Warnings (Yellow Underline)
These are advisory issues that may indicate problems but are not strictly required:

- **Undefined Items**: Items used in the mmCIF file that are not defined in the dictionary
- **Advisory Range Violations** (`_pdbx_item_range`): Values outside the advisory boundary conditions (but within allowed range)

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7 or higher** - The extension uses a Python script for validation
- **Internet connection** (optional) - Only needed if using the default dictionary URL

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not working

1. Check that Python is installed and accessible: `python --version`
2. Check the VSCode Output panel (View → Output → Select "PDBe mmCIF Validator")
3. Verify your settings in File → Preferences → Settings

### Python not found

1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Add Python to your system PATH
3. Or set `mmcifValidator.pythonPath` to the full path to Python

### Validation errors

1. Check that the dictionary file/URL is accessible
2. Verify the mmCIF file format is correct
3. Large files may take time to validate (30 second timeout)

## Standalone Python Script

This extension includes a standalone Python validation script that can be used independently of VSCode. See the `python-script/` folder for:
- The Python validation script (`validate_mmcif.py`)
- Command-line usage instructions
- Standalone validation without VSCode
- Enhanced JSON output with precise character positions and column indices for programmatic error handling
- Exit codes: 0 for success, 1 for errors (useful for CI/CD integration)
